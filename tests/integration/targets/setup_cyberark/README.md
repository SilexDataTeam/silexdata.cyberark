# setup_cyberark integration target

**Rename this directory to `setup_cyberark` after running
`ansible-galaxy collection init`.** `ansible-galaxy` only renders file
*contents*, never file or directory names, so this placeholder directory name
(`setup_EXAMPLE`) is left for you to rename by hand.

This is the setup role every `<module_name>` integration target in this
collection should declare as a `meta/main.yml` dependency (see the
`EXAMPLE_MODULE/` target, which you should also rename to your real module's
name). It is responsible for:

1. Initializing the shared `setup_cyberark_*` variables
   (credentials/endpoint placeholders, using the `.invalid` TLD so a dry run
   reliably reports the service as unavailable).
2. Probing whether the real service is reachable and recording the result in
   a `setup_cyberark_service_available` fact.
3. Either failing the run (if `setup_cyberark_require_service` is
   `true`) or emitting a warning containing the `SETUP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`
   marker token (if not) when the service is unreachable.

## Why gate on service availability at all

This lets the full test suite — including live, service-dependent assertions
— run in CI without real credentials: argument-validation and check-mode
tests always run, while live tests are automatically skipped (with a visible
warning) when there is nothing to talk to. Pipelines that must have live
coverage set `setup_cyberark_require_service: true` (e.g. via
`tests/integration/integration_config.yml`, see
`tests/integration/integration_config.yml.template`) to turn that warning into
a hard failure instead.

## Before you can use this for real

`tasks/main.yml` and `defaults/main.yml` are deliberately left with several
`# TODO` markers: this skeleton cannot know the real authentication shape
(single grouped dict vs. flat parameters), endpoint host/port, or which
Python libraries your modules need. Fill those in based on the actual service
this collection targets, following the `.invalid`-dry-run-default pattern
already in place.
